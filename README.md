This library contains a set of useful functions that have
either been developed or acquired by the Image-Guided
Ultrasound Therapy Lab (a.k.a. Histotripsy Lab) at the 
University of Michigan Department of Biomedical 
Engineering.

If you are a member of the lab and would like to contribute
to the codebase, let me know and we can make that happen.
